            Career choice has a pivotal role in college students’ life planning. In today’s world choosing the right career is the toughest decision. Today many students are confused about their future. They do possess some skills but they are not able to identify their abilities and a proper domain. Different people suggest different career options but at last, the student has to select their career. <br> <br>

             In this project, we have focused on this problem of the student using machine learning. With the help of machine learning, we will help the student to decide which is the best career option and domain for them using different machine learning techniques. The career is decided based on academic information filled by the student. This project will help the student to get directed towards a specific domain as per their skills.
